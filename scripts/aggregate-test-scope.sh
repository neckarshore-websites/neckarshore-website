# aggregate-test-scope.sh — roll up per-repo stats.json files into the estate test-scope object.
#
# Pure aggregation (dir-in → JSON-out): given a stats-config.json (repos[] with an optional
# statsPath each) and a directory of already-fetched per-repo stats.json files, it sums the
# additive estate contribution and emits the decomposed estate test-scope object on stdout.
#
# The fetch (curl over the GitHub contents API) deliberately lives in the caller
# (.github/workflows/update-stats.yml), so THIS file — the bug-prone jq logic — is the exact
# code path the unit test exercises (tests/unit/aggregate-test-scope.test.mjs). Separation of
# concerns: network I/O in YAML, no-double-count math here.
#
# No-double-count contract (docs/reference/stats-json-contract.md):
#   - .tests.total and .tests.byType are ADDITIVE (distinct runner totals; sum(byType)==total).
#   - .tests.lenses are OVERLAPPING, display-only subsets — NEVER summed into total or byType.
# Fail-closed-visible:
#   - a repo with a statsPath whose file is absent/unparseable contributes 0, emits a WARN on
#     stderr, and lands in missing[]. Never a silent 0.
# Fail-soft (rollout window):
#   - a producer with a numeric .tests.total but no .tests.byType (the live omnopsis-backend
#     OLD shape, before the Task-1 producer lands) still contributes its total; byType → {}.
#
# Floor seed (optional 3rd arg — backlog #244):
#   A repo that does NOT yet self-report a stats.json (Plan 3 rollout pending) can still
#   contribute its audited test count via a committed seed file ({floor, repos:[{repo,total}]}).
#   Seed repos are ADDED to the live rollup, but a LIVE producer with the same `repo` slug WINS
#   (the seed entry is dropped) → no double-count; the number auto-corrects toward live data as
#   repos start self-reporting. `reporting`/`expected`/`missing` stay LIVE-ONLY (a seed entry is
#   not a "producer"). `floor:true` from the seed propagates to the output (→ the public tile's
#   load-bearing "+"). Without a seed arg the behaviour is unchanged (floor:false, per_repo=live).
#   A seed row's `audited_sha` (Durchstich SHA that produced its total, or null) is PROPAGATED into
#   the rollup; the seed's `sha_note` (internal provenance) is NOT. Un-audited rows stay null.
#
# SHA-stamp coverage (Test Charter — the estate count is auditable, SHA-stamped):
#   The output carries `unstamped[]` = merged rows with audited_sha:null (pre-withhold = the TRUE
#   audit signal), and the script emits a stderr WARN listing them. Fail-OPEN: the warn NEVER
#   changes the exit code (guardrail #244 — the count must keep publishing).
#
# Usage:  aggregate-test-scope.sh <stats-config.json> <stats-dir> [seed.json]
#   stats-dir holds one file per fetched producer, named "<owner>__<name>.json".
# Output: estate test-scope JSON on stdout (no updatedAt — the caller stamps that).
