/**
 * Dependency CVE gate with an EXPIRING allowlist.
 *
 * Replaces a bare `npm audit --audit-level=high`, which had no way to say
 * "we know about this one and it has no forward fix". Without that, a single
 * unfixable transitive advisory turns a required check permanently red and
 * blocks every merge — including the merge that fixes the OTHER advisories.
 * That is exactly what happened on 2026-07-27: `sharp` (libvips) pinned this
 * repo shut while six Next.js advisories, among them SSRF in rewrites and
 * unauthenticated disclosure of internal Server Function endpoints, sat
 * waiting behind it.
 *
 * DESIGN RULES, in order of importance:
 *
 *  1. FAIL CLOSED. Every unexpected condition exits non-zero: malformed audit
 *     JSON, an empty payload, a missing `vulnerabilities` key, an allowlist
 *     entry whose shape is wrong, an unparseable date. A gate that fails open
 *     is worse than no gate, because it reports green.
 *  2. AN ENTRY EXPIRES. Past its date the build goes red EVEN IF the advisory
 *     is gone. That forces a human to look again instead of letting a
 *     temporary acceptance become permanent silence. This mirrors the sandbox
 *     repo's decay-check.yml, where a deadline is enforced by a job rather
 *     than by memory.
 *  3. MATCH ON ADVISORY ID, NEVER ON PACKAGE NAME. npm reports a parent
 *     package as high purely because a child is (`next` shows up "via: sharp"
 *     with no advisory of its own). Allowlisting by package name would
 *     therefore suppress far more than intended, and would silently keep
 *     suppressing it after the child was fixed. Collecting the distinct GHSA
 *     ids across the whole tree sidesteps that entirely.
 *  4. NO NEW DEPENDENCY. `audit-ci` and `better-npm-audit` both solve this,
 *     and both mean adding a dependency to the thing whose job is auditing
 *     dependencies. This is ~120 lines of zero-dep Node, in the same style as
 *     scripts/check-private-slug-leak.sh.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/audit-gate.mjs
 * Tests:  node scripts/audit-gate.test.mjs

/**
 * Advisories we consciously accept, each with a reason and a hard expiry.
 *
 * Adding a line here is a DECISION, not a formality. Two questions must both
 * be answered in the reason: why can this not be fixed today, and what would
 * have to change for it to be removed.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT SHARED ACROSS REPOS. The logic below is duplicated in
 * oakwoodgolfclub-website, and that is the point: the ALLOWLIST is per-repo
 * because the advisory sets genuinely differ (that repo carries js-yaml via
 * gray-matter, which this one does not; this one carried postcss, which it
 * does not). A shared package would invite one list to be applied to a repo
 * whose dependency tree it does not describe — suppressing advisories nobody
 * looked at. Two files, two decisions.

  // The sharp entry (GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj) was removed 2026-09-09, seven weeks before its
  // 2026-10-31 expiry. It named its own removal condition — "Removable when Next widens its
  // sharp range to >=0.35.0" — and that is exactly what happened: next@16.3.4 declares
  // sharp "^0.35.4" (was: a range resolving to 0.34.5), so the tree now resolves sharp to
  // 0.35.4 and the advisory is FIXED, not suppressed. Verified before removal, not assumed:
  // `require("sharp/package.json").version` -> 0.35.4. The gate itself flagged the entry as
  // inert on the bump branch ("Listed but no longer reported"), which is the same signal that
  // retired the brace-expansion and nanoid entries above. Same shape, same evidence bar.
  // The nanoid entry (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8) was removed 2026-08-26, on the day its own
  // expiry fell due. It named its removal condition itself — "the moment the cooldown is
  // lifted or rolled forward" — and the cooldown is gone: `npm config get before` is null
  // and `npm pack nanoid@3.3.18 --dry-run` fetches the tarball. The advisory is not
  // suppressed now, it is FIXED: package.json carries an `overrides` entry pinning nanoid
  // to 3.3.18, because the path is purely transitive (@tailwindcss/postcss -> postcss ->
  // nanoid) and postcss's `^3.3.16` range is already satisfied by 3.3.17, so `npm update`
  // will not lift it. Same shape as the brace-expansion removal below.
  // Both brace-expansion entries (GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg, GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895) removed
  // 2026-08-12. Their own text named the condition for removal — "the bump fix is
  // barred by the install freeze, re-decide at freeze lift" — and the freeze lifted
  // that morning. `npm audit fix` then resolved both, and the gate's own
  // "listed but no longer reported" line confirmed the entries had gone inert.
  // An acceptance that outlives its reason is how a temporary exception becomes
  // permanent silence, which is exactly what design rule 2 exists to prevent.
