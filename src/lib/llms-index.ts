/**
 * `llms.txt` builder — the curated INDEX for AI readers (llmstxt.org).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: until 2026-08-15 the index was a hand-written static file
 * (`public/llms.txt`). It carried a product list, a test-count claim and a pricing
 * claim that the rendered site had already moved past — two hand-written
 * representations of the same facts with no mechanism between them (backlog #514,
 * class: "a hand-refreshed representation of a fact that moved"). Everything that
 * CAN be derived is now derived:
 *
 *   - the product tree comes from `PORTFOLIO` (same source as /products, the nav
 *     dropdown and the sitemap) → a new product appears here with no edit;
 *   - the audited test figure comes from `public/stats.json` → the same artifact the
 *     Tests tile renders, including its `floor` "+" semantics;
 *   - the date comes from `SITE_UPDATED`.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS HAND-WRITTEN: the prose blocks below (About, Founder, Services,
 * Differentiators, Contact). They mirror page copy and have no machine source, so
 * `tests/unit/llms-claims.test.ts` guards the NAMED claims that went stale before.
 * That guard is honest about its scope: named claims only, not the class.
 *
 * LANGUAGE: the framing prose is English (AI readers of a DACH company site arrive in
 * both languages); the per-product taglines are the German originals from `PORTFOLIO`
 * rather than a second, hand-maintained English copy that would drift. Mixed on
 * purpose — a translated duplicate is exactly the defect this file removes.
 *
 * Build-time only: the route is `force-static`, so the `readFileSync` below runs at
 * build and the result is served as a static CDN asset.

 * The trailing "+" is load-bearing and carries `floor`: the exact figure still
 * UNDER-states the true count, so it is a floor, not a ceiling (StatsGrid.tsx).
 *
 * Digits are written plain (`3391+`), not de-DE grouped (`3.391+`): a machine reader
 * can parse a German thousands dot as a decimal point, and this file's entire audience
 * is machine readers.

> Stuttgart-basiertes KI-Dokumentations- und Nearshore-Softwareentwicklungsunternehmen. Gründer: German Rauhut (Ex-Mercedes-Benz IT). Website: neckarshore.ai.

Last updated: ${SITE_UPDATED}

## About

Neckarshore AI (neckarshore.ai) is a nearshore AI and software development partner based in Stuttgart, Germany. We help mid-sized companies in the DACH region build software faster and more reliably — combining German engineering precision with modern AI acceleration. Same timezone, same language, same data protection standards (DSGVO by default).

## Founder

German Rauhut — former Mercedes-Benz IT, now founder of Neckarshore AI in Stuttgart.

## Flagship Product

Omnopsis Documentor+X — an AI-first documentation engine that generates compliance docs, technical documentation and persona-aware chatbot answers from Git, Jira and Confluence. BYOLLM (Bring Your Own LLM), fail-closed architecture, European hosting. In development; no public launch date announced.

## Products

neckarshore.ai builds across four tiers: flagships, MMPs (Minimum Marketable Products), focused open-source skills, and client/own websites. Product names, one-liners and status below are generated from the same source as the site's own product pages. Full tree: ${SITE_URL}/products

${PORTFOLIO.map(renderCategory).join("\n\n")}

## Services

1. AI-Powered Development — NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL production stack
2. Documentation Automation — Omnopsis Documentor+X
3. AI Consulting & Strategy — LLM selection, automation assessment
4. DSGVO-by-Design — BYOLLM, tenant isolation, German hosting
5. Quality Engineering — ${tests} automated tests across the estate (audited, floor figure), OWASP LLM Top 10, EU AI Act
6. Nearshore Partnership — team extension, remote-first, scalable

## Key Differentiators

- vs. Offshore: same timezone, same language, DSGVO-compliant by default
- vs. Big-4: significantly more cost-effective at comparable quality; direct access to engineers instead of a junior-heavy bench model. Concrete pricing is discussed in the 30-minute intro call.
- vs. Freelancers: structured processes, full project ownership, delivery that does not depend on a single person
