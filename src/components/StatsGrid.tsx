/**

 * NO REF GUARD, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This hook used to carry a
 * `hasAnimated` ref that returned early on the second run. Under React's
 * double-invocation of effects (StrictMode, which `next dev` turns on) that
 * guard is fatal rather than defensive: run 1 sets the ref and starts the
 * interval, the cleanup clears the interval, run 2 sees the ref — refs survive
 * the remount — and bails. No interval is ever started again and every tile
 * stays at 0. Measured on next@16.3.4: eight of twelve stats e2e tests red,
 * `Received: 0`; the same suite is 12/12 on 16.2.12, same machine.
 *
 * The guard was also redundant. The dep array is `[target]`, so the effect
 * already re-runs only when the target actually changes, and the cleanup
 * already cancels the previous interval. It protected against nothing.
 *
 * Scope of the original defect, stated precisely because it is easy to
 * overstate: PRODUCTION WAS NEVER AFFECTED. React does not double-invoke
 * effects in a production build — verified against `npm run build && npm run
 * start` in a real browser, where the tiles read 8.689 / 1.208.919 / 41. What
 * broke was the dev server, and with it the e2e suite that runs against it.
