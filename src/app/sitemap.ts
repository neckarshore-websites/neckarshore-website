/**
 * Dynamic sitemap — the route set is derived from the portfolio config
 * (allProductRoutes) so it stays in sync as products are added. Replaces static
 * public/sitemap.xml (deleted 2026-04-10).
 *
 * `lastModified` carries the STABLE, content-derived SITE_UPDATED date — NOT a
 * build-time `new Date()`. A per-build timestamp stamped every url as "changed
 * today" on every deploy, a false freshness signal a crawler learns to distrust
 * (SEO/GEO audit 2026-06-23). See site-config.ts for the bump rule + the deferred
 * per-page-freshness upgrade path.
 *
 * Deprecated tags (changefreq, priority) intentionally omitted — Google has
 * ignored them since 2023. Only <loc> and <lastmod> carry signal.
