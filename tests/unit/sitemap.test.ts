/**
 * Unit tests for the dynamic sitemap (src/app/sitemap.ts).
 *
 * The bug this guards (SEO/GEO audit 2026-06-23): the sitemap stamped
 * `lastModified = new Date()` on every entry, so every url carried the BUILD
 * timestamp and "changed" on every deploy — a false freshness signal Google
 * learns to distrust. The fix stamps the stable, content-derived SITE_UPDATED.
 *
 * Why assert against the CONSTANT, not a fetch-twice comparison: the sitemap is
 * generated once at build time, so `new Date()` freezes per build — two reads in
 * the same process return the SAME value and a fetch-twice test stays green WITH
 * the bug. Asserting `lastmod === SITE_UPDATED` (≠ today) is what actually catches it.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:unit`
